### Pita ID: Text Extraction from KTP using OCR

Pita ID comes from the word "Pindai Data" which means scanning data. Pita ID is a project that aims to extract text data from Indonesian ID cards (KTP) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This project is designed to help users easily extract and digitize information from KTPs, such as name, address, and ID number, for various purposes, including registration, verification, and data entry.

The steps to extract text data from KTP using Pita ID are as follows:

1. Capture Image: Users take a photo of the KTP using the Pita ID mobile app.
2. Image Processing: The app processes the image to enhance the text quality and remove noise.
3. Text Extraction: The OCR technology extracts text data from the image.
4. Data Verification: Users can verify and edit the extracted data before saving it.
5. Data Storage: The extracted data is stored securely on the user's device or cloud storage.

Pita ID offers a user-friendly interface and seamless text extraction process to provide a convenient solution for digitizing KTP information.

Not only that, Pita ID also provides job match making by processing extracted data and finding the suit job for the user by dependant variables such as age and home address.
